This program lets you modify images and videos with speech bubbles or captions. To use it, ensure you have the following requirements installed:

* PIL library: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html
* moviepy library: https://zulko.github.io/moviepy/install.html
* numpy library: https://numpy.org/install/

Place your file in the program folder, run "run.bat," and choose option 1 for speech bubbles or option 2 for captions. Enter the file name (e.g., test.png for PNG) and, for option 2, enter the file name and caption text.
