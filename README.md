This program lets you modify images and videos with speech bubbles or captions. Place your file in the program folder, run "run.bat," and choose option 1 for speech bubbles or option 2 for captions. Enter the file name (e.g., test.png for PNG) and, for option 2, enter the file name and caption text.
